P(A and B) = P(B and A)

this only works, if A and B occur independent of one another:
P(A) P(B) = P(A and B)

P(B|A) means: "probability, that B occurs when A has already occured"

if A and B occur in dependence of one another:
P(A and B) = P(B|A) P(A)
P(B and A) = P(A|B) P(B)
P(B|A) P(A) = P(A|B) P(B)
P(A|B) = ( P(B|A) P(A) ) / P(B)

this is called the "diachromatic interpretation of bayes' theorem".

posterior = (prior * likelyhood) / normalizing constant
P(H|D)    = ( P(H)      P(D|H) ) / P(D)

H = hypothesis
D = data
