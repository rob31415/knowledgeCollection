rule 1) don't put too much on one line
rule 2) don't break atomic thoughts into subatomic particles

those rules conflict.

a suggestion by r. hettinger:
one line of code = one sentence in english


an example in python:

result = []
for i in range(10):
	s = i ** 2
	result.append(s)
print(sum(result))

this tells HOW to do it, step by step.
it violates rule 2).


print( sum(i ** 2 for i in range(10)) )

this tells WHAT to do.
it's equivalent to a sentece in english.
in this case, it can even be read from left to right:
"print the sum of squared numbers, over all the numbers from 0 to 9."
