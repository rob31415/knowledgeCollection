binary search upper/lower bound
longest common substring
long repeated substring: brute force (check all pairs), suffix sorting with insertion sort, s.s.w. mergesort, ssw index sort


sorting: insert, select, heap, merge, quick, bubble, shell, comb, counting, bucket, radix, index, 3-way-string quicksort

count and generate combinatorial objects: permute, subset

monads

weighted graphs:

monte carlo, local search, simulated annealing

algos: Partition_problem, kd-trees, suffix trees, bin packing, Subset_sum_problem, Knapsack_problem, edit distance, Longest_common_subsequence_problem, count occurrences
